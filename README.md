Introduction
This repository contains a comparative analysis of several machine learning models used to predict solar radiation. The dataset used for this analysis is published by NASA and is available on Kaggle. The models compared in this analysis include:

Linear Regression (LR)
Random Forest (RF)
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
XGBoost (XGB)
Ensemble Model
Additionally, we have created a PowerBI dashboard to visualize the results and provide insights.
